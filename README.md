# Homework Template

This README is a template for your homework assignments.  **You'll need to edit this accordingly.**

--- 

Please make sure this **README** contains the following information:
1. Your name;
2. Instructions for running the code.  You'll probably need multiple terminal windows to run your ROS code...be sure you explain exactly what to do in each window.  For example:
    - Terminal 1 - Launch `roscore`:
        ```
        roscore
        ```

    - Terminal 2 - Run Python script:
        ```
        cd some/path/to/files
        rosrun package_name script_name.py
        ```

---

Please also make sure your **repository** contains your necessary source code.  It is recommended that you upload the entire "package" directory. 
- For example, suppose you have a package called `wanderbot`, which is found in `~/catkin_ws/src/wanderbot/`.  Then the root of your repository should have a folder called `wanderbot` and a `README.md` file.  All of your code would go inside the `wanderbot` directory.
